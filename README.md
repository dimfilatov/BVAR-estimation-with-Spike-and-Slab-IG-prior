In this tutorial, using simulated data I estimate BVAR model assuming Spike-and-Slab prior of coefficients of autoregressive matrix and Inverse-Gamma (IG) prior of variance-covariance matrix. All derivations of posterior distribution and specifics on Gibbs sampler can be found in the appendix of the paper https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3464679.
